Notes on parameter tweaking (from the reviewer)

max_line_gap 
- maximum distance(in pixels) between segments that will be allowed to connect into a single line.

min_line_len 
- minimum length of a line (in pixels) that we will accept in the output

1. Increasing min_line_len and max_line_gap(~100 and above) for Hough Transform will make your lines longer and will have less number of breaks.(this will make the solid annotated line longer in the output)

2. Increasing max_line_gap will allow points that are farther away from each other to be connected with a single line. threshold increasing(~ 50-60) will rule out the spurious lines.(defines the minimum number of intersections in a given grid cell that are required to choose a line.)

3. kernel-size in the Gaussian Filter will remove the noise making the image less blurry. Must be an odd number (3, 5, 7...)

4. Use rho value of 2 or 1 which gives distance resolution in pixels of the Hough grid

5. Can a different colour space be used to make the pipeline more robust. (HSL, YUV etc)
